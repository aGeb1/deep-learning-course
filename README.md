This is a repository for the various projects that I did for the Cooper Union course Deep Learning, ECE 472. 
These projects include training residual networks on the CIFAR image classification task (Homework 4) and implementing a decoder-only transformer (Homework 6).
Every homework except one (Homework 5) was implemented in Tensorflow without Keras.
